# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to take raw data pertaining to a list of cryptocurrencies (names, algorithms, proof types, and coin supply and mining amounts) and conduct unsupervised machine learning to uncover patterns in the data. The patterns could then be used to create classification groupings for a cryptocurrency investment portfolio.

After conducting the unsupervised machine learning, two visualizations were made: a 3d plot showing classifications of the currencies according to three principal components, as well as a scatterplot comparing coin classes on the total coin supply and the total amount mined. These plots can be seen below.
